### Technical challenge

#### Main Task
Design and implement automation suite to test [https://revolut.com](https://revolut.com).
You are free to choose any programming language and frameworks. 
These test scenarios should be covered:

1. Go to Help -> Community. Press search, find and open the topic “We got a banking licence”. Verify “We got a banking licence” topic text.
2. Go to Help -> Community. Verify keyboard shortcuts. (You can find shortcuts under “hamburger” menu on the top)
3. Scroll to the bottom. Click on “United Kingdom” flag and change country to “United States”. Verify page url.  

#### Bonus
Add as many tests as you want.

#### NB
You can also briefly describe what else could be done and improved in the solution that you provide.

Pay more attention to the quality of the code and its structure, rather than the number of covered scenarios.
